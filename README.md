Runs the initial installation of npm packages.

### `npm outdated`

Lists npm packages that are not the latest allowable version as per the `package.json` file.

### `npm update`

Updates npm packages (top-level only) to the latest allowable version as per the `package.json` file.

### `npm dedupe`

Fixes "blah cannot be used as a JSX component" errors.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Hacks

* [Material-Table Mutates Item Passed Through data Prop](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues/1371) - Because of this, we have to assign the data source a _copy_ of the data array rather than just assigning the array itself.
